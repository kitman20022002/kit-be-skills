  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: The concept of the Bean lifecycle is a core part of the Spring
    framework, originating from the need to manage Java objects (known as Beans) within the Spring
    container.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Before its emergence</strong>: Before the advent of the Spring framework, the
      creation, initialization, and destruction of Java objects had to be manually managed by
      programmers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>After its emergence</strong>: The emergence of Spring provided an automated way to
      manage the lifecycle of Java Beans, greatly simplifying object management.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essence</strong>: The Bean lifecycle in the Spring framework refers to the process a
    Bean undergoes from creation to destruction. During this process, a Bean goes through various
    stages, including instantiation, property setting, initialization, and destruction.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Container Management</strong>: The entire lifecycle of a Bean is managed by the Spring
      container.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lifecycle Callbacks</strong>: Custom logic can be executed at different stages of the
      lifecycle by implementing specific interfaces or using annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: The Spring container injects dependencies at
      appropriate stages in the Bean's lifecycle.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Case Explanation</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Background</strong>: Suppose there is a Bean for a database connection.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: In the Spring container, this database connection Bean would first
      be instantiated, then have its dependencies injected, followed by the execution of an
      initialization method, and finally, a destruction method when the container shuts down.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: Understanding and using the Bean lifecycle can be relatively
    complex, especially in scenarios involving multiple Beans with interdependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Currently, the industry is moving towards simplifying
    lifecycle management, providing more automation and annotation-driven lifecycle callbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: In the future, the Spring framework may further enhance its
    capabilities in managing the Bean lifecycle, such as through more intelligent dependency
    injection and lifecycle callbacks to optimize application performance.
