  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: Inversion of Control (IoC) as a software design principle aims to
    reduce the coupling between computer codes. The emergence of IoC containers in Java,
    particularly in modern frameworks like Spring, was intended to further implement this principle.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Before its emergence</strong>: Before the advent of IoC containers, objects were
      typically created and managed directly in the code, leading to high coupling and difficulty in
      testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>After its emergence</strong>: The introduction of IoC containers changed the way
      objects are created and managed, allowing developers to focus more on business logic while
      improving code maintainability and scalability.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essence</strong>: An IoC container is a framework or library that manages the creation,
    configuration, and lifecycle of objects in a Java application. It manages objects by inverting
    control, meaning that the container takes over the creation and management of objects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Inversion of Control</strong>: Objects no longer create and manage dependencies
      themselves; instead, the container is responsible for this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: The container provides the necessary dependencies to
      objects through Dependency Injection (DI).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Declarative Management</strong>: The configuration of objects and their dependencies
      is usually declared through configuration files or annotations, without the need for hard
      coding in Java code.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Case Explanation</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Background</strong>: Suppose there is a class in a Java application that requires
      multiple service components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: With an IoC container, the class does not need to create and manage
      these service components itself. The container automatically injects the required components,
      allowing the class to focus on its business logic.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: Using an IoC container might lead to complex project structures
    and can be challenging for beginners to understand and master.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Currently, the industry is moving towards simplifying
    the configuration and use of IoC containers to improve their usability and flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: In the future, IoC containers may become more automated and
    intelligent, for instance, through more advanced dependency resolution and management mechanisms
    to enhance efficiency and reduce configuration errors.
