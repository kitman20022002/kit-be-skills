    <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>
      The Context API is a feature of React designed to solve the problem of data transmission in
      the component tree.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: In the early versions of React, passing data across multiple layers
        of components required prop drilling, which was cumbersome and inefficient in complex
        component trees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparison</strong>: Before the Context API, React applications often relied on
        additional state management libraries (like Redux) to manage cross-component states. The
        introduction of the Context API allows for internal state management within React in less
        complex scenarios without using these libraries.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      The Context API allows developers to share values across components without having to
      explicitly pass props through every level of the component tree.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Method of Solution</strong>: It works by creating a Context object, which can be
        accessed at any point in the tree.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Three Key Principles</strong>:
        <ol>
          <li>Avoid overusing Context; it should not be used for passing all states.</li>
          <li>Maintain the independence and reusability of components when using it.</li>
          <li>Consider using Context when multiple components need to access the same data.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Background</dt>
      <dd>
        Suppose there is a theme switching feature that needs to share theme settings across
        multiple components.
      </dd>
      <dt>Application</dt>
      <dd>
        Use the Context API to create a theme Context, which can be accessed and modified in any
        child component.
      </dd>
      <dt>Code Example</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre><code>
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            &lt;ThemeContext.Provider value="dark"&gt;
                &lt;Toolbar /&gt;
            &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;
        );
    }
}

function Toolbar(props) {
    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;ThemedButton /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
    static contextType = ThemeContext;
    render() {
        return &lt;Button theme={this.context} /&gt;;
    }
}
                </code></pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Limitations</strong>: The Context API is not suitable for data that updates
        frequently, as it may lead to performance issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direction for Optimization</strong>: Combine the use of the Context API with other
        state management methods (like Hooks) to improve performance and code maintainability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future Development</strong>: Future versions of React may further optimize the
        performance of the Context API and add more related features and improvements.
      </li>
