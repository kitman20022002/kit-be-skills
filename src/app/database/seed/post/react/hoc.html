  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    Higher Order Components (HOC) are an advanced technique in the React framework for reusing
    component logic.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Origin</strong>: They originate from the concept of higher-order functions in
      functional programming. At the early stages of React's development, as component logic became
      complex, there was a need for a pattern to share this logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Comparison</strong>: Before the advent of HOCs, reusing logic in React components was
      commonly done through mixins. With the introduction of HOCs, logic reuse became clearer and
      more modular.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    A Higher Order Component is essentially a function that takes a component and returns a new
    component.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Method of Solution</strong>: HOCs enhance or inject additional props into the original
      component by wrapping and composing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Three Key Principles</strong>:
      <ol>
        <li>Do not modify the original component within the HOC, instead, use composition.</li>
        <li>Pass through unrelated props.</li>
        <li>Maximize composability.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Background</dt>
    <dd>
      Suppose there is a text input component that needs data validation and logging functionality.
    </dd>
    <dt>Application</dt>
    <dd>
      Create an HOC that adds validation and logging functionality to the original component, then
      use this HOC to enhance the text input component.
    </dd>
    <dt>Code Example</dt>
    <dd>
      <pre><code>
    function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
        return function(props) {
            // Logging logic
            console.log('Logging...');
            // Return the enhanced component
            return &lt;WrappedComponent {...props} /&gt;;
        };
    }
            </code></pre>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Limitations</strong>: HOCs can lead to prop name conflicts and potentially increase
      the complexity of the component tree.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Direction for Optimization</strong>: Use new React features like Hooks to simplify
      shared logic and reduce dependency on HOCs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Future Development</strong>: In future versions of React, Hooks and other functional
      programming techniques might replace some use cases of HOCs.
    </li>
  </ul>
