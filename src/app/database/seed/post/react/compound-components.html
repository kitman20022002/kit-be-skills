  <h1>Compound Components</h1>

  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: Compound Components is a design pattern commonly used in front-end
    development, especially with modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React. It emerged
    to address the issues of state management and reusability in User Interface (UI) components.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Before its emergence</strong>: Prior to compound components, developers typically
      managed interactions between components by passing callbacks and state, which could lead to
      complex and hard-to-maintain code structures.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>After its emergence</strong>: With the introduction of compound components, developers
      could manage relationships and states between components more concisely, enhancing code
      readability and maintainability.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essence</strong>: The compound component pattern allows you to decompose a component
    into several closely related subcomponents, each responsible for rendering a part of the
    interface, while still collectively forming a unified component.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Modularity</strong>: Each subcomponent is independent and can be used alone or in
      combination with other components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reusability</strong>: Subcomponents are designed to ensure sufficient flexibility and
      reusability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>State Management</strong>: The parent component usually manages the state, and the
      subcomponents receive the state and callbacks through props.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Case Explanation</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Background</strong>: Suppose you need to create a customizable tab component in a web
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: You can create a compound component that includes a parent
      component (TabContainer) managing the state, and child components (TabItem) representing each
      tab. This way, you can reuse the TabItem component in different places, with all state
      management handled by the TabContainer.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: Compound components can lead to overly complex component
    structures, especially in large projects, and may be difficult to understand for beginners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: The current industry trend is to simplify the API
    design of compound components to improve their readability and usability.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: In the future, compound components might be integrated with
    more front-end development technologies (like micro-frontends) to further enhance component
    maintainability and scalability.
