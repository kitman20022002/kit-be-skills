    <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>
      State is a core concept in React applications, used to control the behavior and rendering of
      components.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: React's design philosophy is reactive and declarative, where the
        concept of state provides a dynamic data source for components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparison</strong>: Before React, traditional JavaScript DOM manipulation was
        mostly imperative, involving direct DOM manipulation to change the interface. React
        introduced the concept of state as a more efficient way to control interface updates.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      In React, the state is an object that stores data affecting the rendering and behavior of a
      component.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Method of Solution</strong>: State allows components to update themselves based on
        changes in user interaction or other factors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Three Key Principles</strong>:
        <ol>
          <li>State should be as simple as possible to avoid unnecessary complexity.</li>
          <li>
            State updates may be asynchronous, so new state should not rely on the current state
            value.
          </li>
          <li>
            State should be limited to data that affects rendering, avoiding storing unrelated data
            in the state.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Background</dt>
      <dd>
        Suppose there is a numeric counter component that needs to display and update a number
        count.
      </dd>
      <dt>Application</dt>
      <dd>
        Use state to store the count value, and update the state to increase the count when a button
        is clicked.
      </dd>
      <dt>Code Example</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre><code>
class Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    incrementCount = () => {
        this.setState(prevState => ({
            count: prevState.count + 1
        }));
    };

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;{this.state.count}&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;button onClick={this.incrementCount}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}
                </code></pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Limitations</strong>: Improper management of state can lead to components being
        difficult to maintain, especially in large projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direction for Optimization</strong>: Use state management libraries (like Redux,
        MobX) or the Context API for better state sharing between components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future Development</strong>: Future versions of React may introduce more tools and
        methods to simplify state management, enhancing the performance and maintainability of
        applications.
