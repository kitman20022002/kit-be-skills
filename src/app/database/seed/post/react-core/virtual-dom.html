    <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>
      The Virtual DOM is a core concept in the React framework, developed to enhance the performance
      and efficiency of applications.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: The concept of the Virtual DOM was proposed by the React developer
        team to solve the problem of efficiently updating the view.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparison</strong>: Before the Virtual DOM, most JavaScript frameworks and
        libraries operated directly on the actual DOM, which often resulted in inefficient
        performance during large-scale updates.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object, representing a version of the DOM in
      memory.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Method of Solution</strong>: By simulating DOM operations in memory instead of
        directly on the actual DOM, React minimizes the number of real DOM manipulations, thereby
        enhancing performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Three Key Principles</strong>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The Virtual DOM allows React to calculate the most efficient method of updating the DOM
            beforehand, in memory.
          </li>
          <li>
            React updates the actual DOM only when necessary, reducing unnecessary DOM
            manipulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the Virtual DOM can increase the responsiveness and overall performance of
            applications.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Background</dt>
      <dd>
        Imagine an application with frequent UI updates, such as a dynamic interactive interface.
      </dd>
      <dt>Application</dt>
      <dd>
        With the Virtual DOM, React can quickly calculate the minimal range of updates and
        efficiently update the UI without redrawing the entire interface.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Limitations</strong>: While the Virtual DOM improves performance, it also introduces
        additional computational and memory overhead.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direction for Optimization</strong>: Further optimize the Virtual DOM algorithm to
        reduce computational overhead and memory usage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future Development</strong>: Future developments may focus on making the Virtual DOM
        even more efficient and implementing similar concepts in other frameworks and libraries.
      </li>
    </ul>
