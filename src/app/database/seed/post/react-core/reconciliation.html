    <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>Reconciliation is a core process in React used for efficiently updating the UI.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: As React applications became increasingly complex, there was a need
        for an efficient way to determine which parts of the UI needed to be updated to optimize
        performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparison</strong>: Before the reconciliation process, updating the UI might have
        required re-rendering the entire component tree, even if there were only minor changes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Reconciliation is the process used by React to compare differences between the new and old
      virtual DOM trees, and determine the minimal updates needed in the actual DOM.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Method of Solution</strong>: When the state of a component changes, React creates a
        new virtual DOM tree and compares it with the tree from the last render.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Three Key Principles</strong>:
        <ol>
          <li>Update only the elements that have differences, rather than the entire tree.</li>
          <li>Use efficient algorithms to minimize the necessary computations.</li>
          <li>Reuse existing elements as much as possible, instead of creating new ones.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Background</dt>
      <dd>Imagine a list component in which some items' data have changed.</dd>
      <dt>Application</dt>
      <dd>
        React uses the reconciliation algorithm to identify the changed parts and updates only those
        parts of the DOM, rather than the entire list.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Limitations</strong>: While the reconciliation algorithm is efficient, it's not
        perfect. In some cases, it may not identify all the optimal paths for updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Direction for Optimization</strong>: Continuously improve the reconciliation
        algorithm to better identify and handle various update scenarios.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future Development</strong>: The React team and community may continue to explore
        new algorithms and strategies to further enhance the performance and accuracy of the
        reconciliation process.
