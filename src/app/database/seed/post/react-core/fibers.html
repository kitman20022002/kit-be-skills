    <h2>What is Fibers?</h2>
    <p>
      A Fiber is an instance of a component in React, representing a unit of work in the UI. Fibers
      restructure the rendering process into a linked list, optimizing resource allocation and
      rendering performance.

  <section>
    <h2>Origin and Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Background</strong>: React's initial rendering process, before Fibers, was based on
        a recursive call stack, which had limitations in handling intensive UI updates and
        animations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Why Fibers?</strong>: Introduced to enhance React's ability to handle complex UIs
        and improve performance for applications with heavy rendering tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Key Features and Principles</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Incremental Rendering</strong>: Fibers allow React to split rendering work into
        chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prioritization of Tasks</strong>: Enables prioritizing updates based on importance,
        improving responsiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Concurrency</strong>: Allows pausing, resuming, or aborting rendering tasks,
        enhancing efficiency.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Impact and Use</h2>
    <p>
      Fibers contribute to smoother, more responsive user interfaces and maintain a familiar API for
      React developers.

    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
    <p>
      Lays the foundation for future improvements in React, like Concurrent Mode, further enhancing
      rendering and update handling.
