  <h2>2. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: Class loaders in Java are components used to load class files (‘.class’
    files) into the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). They were created to meet the need for dynamic
    loading and linking of class files.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before Appearance: Before class loaders, all classes had to be loaded and linked at once when
      a Java program started, which limited the flexibility and extensibility of Java programs.
    </li>
    <li>
      After Appearance: The introduction of class loaders enabled Java programs to load classes
      dynamically on demand, enhancing program modularity and flexibility.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Concept Explanation</strong>: Class loaders are responsible for reading Java bytecode
    and converting it into classes executable by the JVM. They load class files as needed, avoiding
    the overhead of loading all classes at once.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Three Important Principles</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Delegation Model: By default, a class loader delegates the loading task to its parent loader
      and loads the class itself only if the parent loader fails.
    </li>
    <li>
      Visibility: A child loader can access classes loaded by its parent loader, but the parent
      loader cannot access classes loaded by the child loader.
    </li>
    <li>
      Uniqueness: The same class file, once loaded by the same class loader, exists as only one
      class instance in the JVM.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Real-World Example</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Background: A large application needs to dynamically load plugins.</li>
    <li>
      Solution: The application uses custom class loaders to load different plugins, ensuring that
      the plugins do not interfere with each other and achieving high modularity.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: The complexity of class loaders can lead to issues like class
    conflicts and memory leaks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Currently, the industry is optimizing class loader
    performance and security, such as faster loading speeds and better isolation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: Future developments may include more intelligent class
    loading strategies, like AI-based predictive loading, and improved class loading efficiency in
    cloud environments.
