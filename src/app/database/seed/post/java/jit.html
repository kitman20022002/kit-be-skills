  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: The concept of the JIT compiler originated from the need to improve the
    execution efficiency of programs. Early programs were often executed interpretively, which was
    usually slower. The JIT compiler emerged to enhance the run-time efficiency of programs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Before its emergence</strong>: Before the JIT compiler, programs typically needed to
      be fully compiled before execution or executed line-by-line through an interpreter, each
      method having its limitations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>After its emergence</strong>: The introduction of the JIT compiler allowed programs to
      be compiled just in time during execution, combining the efficiency of pre-compilation with
      the flexibility of interpretive execution.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essence</strong>: A JIT compiler is a runtime compiler that compiles source code or
    bytecode into machine code on the fly to improve the execution efficiency of the program.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Just-In-Time Compilation</strong>: Compiles blocks of code into machine code during
      program execution as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Enhances the speed and efficiency of program
      execution through optimized compiled code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Runtime Analysis</strong>: The JIT compiler can dynamically optimize based on the
      program's runtime behavior.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Case Explanation</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Background</strong>: Java programs run on a virtual machine, and their code exists in
      bytecode form.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: The JIT compiler in the Java Virtual Machine compiles frequently
      executed bytecode into machine code, thus improving the execution speed of these codes.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: JIT compilation consumes certain computing resources, especially
    during the compilation process, which might slightly increase the program's startup time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Modern JIT compilers are being optimized to reduce the
    resource consumption during compilation, improve compilation speed, and implement smarter code
    optimization strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: In the future, JIT compilers may become more intelligent,
    able to more accurately predict which codes will be frequently executed, and achieve more
    efficient runtime optimization.
