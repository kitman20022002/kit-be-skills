  <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: The JVM was designed to realize Java's philosophy of "write once, run
    anywhere." It forms the core part of the Java platform, responsible for running Java bytecode.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before Appearance: Before the advent of the JVM, programs had to be compiled separately for
      each type of hardware and operating system.
    </li>
    <li>
      After Appearance: With the JVM, Java programs can run on any platform that has the JVM
      installed, freeing them from being limited to specific hardware and operating systems.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Concept Explanation</strong>: The JVM is a virtual machine that provides an environment
    to execute Java bytecode. It converts bytecode into machine code specific to each platform.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Three Important Components</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Class Loader: Responsible for loading Java class files into memory.</li>
    <li>
      Runtime Data Area: Stores data during program execution, including the Heap, Stack, Method
      Area, Program Counter, etc.
    </li>
    <li>Execution Engine: Executes the Java bytecode stored in the method area.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Real-World Example</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Background: Running a Java program.</li>
    <li>
      Using the JVM Process: The JVM first loads the required classes through the class loader, then
      allocates memory in the runtime data area, and finally, the execution engine starts executing
      the bytecode.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: Although the JVM provides cross-platform capability, there is
    still room for improvement in performance and memory management.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Currently, the industry is working on optimizing JVM
    performance, reducing memory usage, and improving garbage collection efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: Future developments may include more efficient
    implementations of the JVM, or support for new hardware and technologies, such as optimizations
    for cloud computing and big data.
