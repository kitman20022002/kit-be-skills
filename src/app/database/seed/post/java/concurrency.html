  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: The concepts of concurrency and multithreading originated from the need
    in computer science to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of programs. With the
    proliferation of multi-core processors, these concepts have been widely applied in Java.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Before their emergence</strong>: Before the advent of multithreading and concurrency
      mechanisms, programs typically executed tasks sequentially in a single-threaded manner, unable
      to fully utilize the advantages of multi-core processors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>After their emergence</strong>: With the introduction of concurrency and
      multithreading, Java programs can execute tasks simultaneously on multiple cores,
      significantly enhancing execution efficiency and responsiveness.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p><strong>Essence</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Concurrency</strong>: Refers to multiple tasks being executed macroscopically at the
      same time, but they might alternate execution microscopically, not necessarily running
      simultaneously.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multithreading</strong>: A means of achieving concurrency, where multiple threads are
      created to run tasks on different execution paths.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Three Principles</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Thread Safety</strong>: Ensuring that the access to shared data in a multi-threaded
      environment does not lead to inconsistencies or data corruption.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lock Mechanism</strong>: Using locks or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent
      multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resource Management</strong>: Efficiently managing thread resources, including their
      creation, use, and destruction.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Case Explanation</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Background</strong>: Suppose you need to handle multiple concurrent user requests in a
      web server.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: Multithreading technology can be used to create a thread pool.
      Whenever there's a new user request, a thread from the pool is allocated to handle it, thereby
      improving response speed and processing efficiency.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: Multithreaded programming is complex and prone to errors,
    especially when it involves thread synchronization and shared data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Currently, the industry is moving towards developing
    more advanced concurrency control mechanisms, such as using concurrency frameworks and libraries
    (like Java's java.util.concurrent package) to simplify multithreaded programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: In the future, Java might further integrate smarter thread
    management and concurrency control technologies to increase efficiency and reduce programming
    complexity.
