  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>TypeScript</strong> was born to provide a type system and support for ES6+ on top of
    JavaScript. Before TypeScript's emergence, JavaScript, as a dynamically typed language, was
    highly flexible but prone to type errors in large projects. TypeScriptâ€™s introduction allowed
    developers to detect potential type errors during coding.

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>TypeScript</strong> is a superset of JavaScript, adding a type system and compile-time
    type checking. The three key principles of TypeScript include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Type Annotation:</strong> Allowing developers to specify the type of variables.</li>
    <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Defining the structure of objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Classes and Modules:</strong> Supporting the latest ES6+ features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A simple example: In JavaScript, you might accidentally add a string to a number. Using
    TypeScript, you can specify types for variables, like <code>let num: number = 5;</code> and
    <code>let str: string = "hello";</code>. This way, when you try <code>num + str</code>,
    TypeScript will prompt an error at compile time.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    The main limitation of <strong>TypeScript</strong> is that it adds to the learning curve and
    development time. Currently, the industry is optimizing towards improving compiler performance
    and enhancing support for modern JavaScript features. In the future, TypeScript may continue to
    deepen its integration with the JavaScript ecosystem, providing more intelligent type inference
    and more efficient compilation strategies.
