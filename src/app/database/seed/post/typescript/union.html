  <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <p>
    Union types originate from the type systems in programming, particularly in type theory and
    functional programming. Before union types, programming languages often limited variables and
    function parameters to a single type. The introduction of union types brought flexibility and
    expressiveness by allowing variables to represent multiple possible types.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <p>
    Union types are a variable type that can store one of several different types, such as an
    integer or a string. Key principles of using union types include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Type Diversity: Union types can encompass two or more different types.</li>
    <li>Type Safety: Operations must be safe for all possible types in a union type variable.</li>
    <li>Clarity: Specify the current type as clearly as possible when using union types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Example: In scenarios like writing a function that accepts either a number or a string, a union
    type such as <code>number | string</code> can be used, enhancing the function's flexibility for
    multiple input types.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <p>
    The limitation of union types is in their potential to increase code complexity due to the need
    to handle multiple types. Currently, many programming languages and type systems are developing
    smarter type inference mechanisms to ease the use of union types. In the future, integration
    with advanced type systems, like dependent types, might occur, enhancing expressiveness and
    safety.
