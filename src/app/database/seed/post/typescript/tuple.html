  <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <p>
    Tuples originate from mathematics and computer science, designed to store elements with a fixed
    count and possibly varying types. Before tuples, programming languages had data structures with
    either homogeneous types (like arrays) or variable element counts (like lists). Tuples
    introduced a data structure that is both fixed in number and diverse in type.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <p>
    A tuple is a data structure that holds a fixed number of elements, with each element potentially
    being of a different type. Key principles of tuples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed Number of Elements: The count of elements in a tuple is unchangeable once defined.
    </li>
    <li>Type Diversity: Elements in a tuple can be of different data types.</li>
    <li>Order: The order of elements in a tuple is fixed, accessed by index.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Example: In a programming scenario requiring storing a point's x-coordinate (a number) and a
    label (a string), a tuple like <code>(3.5, "Point A")</code> can be used, where
    <code>3.5</code> is numerical, and <code>"Point A"</code> is a string, ensuring clarity and
    type-safety.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <p>
    The limitations of tuples are their unsuitability for storing many elements or for scenarios
    requiring frequent element modifications. Presently, some languages are enhancing type checking
    and performance for tuples. In the future, tuples may gain broader support in more languages and
    integrate more closely with modern programming concepts like destructuring assignment.
