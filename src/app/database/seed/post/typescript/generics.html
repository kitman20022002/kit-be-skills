  <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <p>
    Generics originate from type systems in computer science, particularly in object-oriented and
    functional programming. Prior to generics, programming data structures and functions could
    typically handle only specific data types. The introduction of generics enabled flexible
    handling of various data types while maintaining type safety.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <p>
    Generics allow for the definition of classes, interfaces, or methods without specifying the
    exact types of data they operate on. Key principles in using generics include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Type Safety: Checking types at compile time rather than runtime.</li>
    <li>Code Reusability: Enabling the same code to be used across different data types.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: Enhancing code flexibility to be applicable for various data types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Example: For creating an array to store any data type, you can define a generic array class like
    <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> can be any type. This allows creation of
    arrays like <code>Array&lt;number&gt;</code> or <code>Array&lt;string&gt;</code> to store
    different data types.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <p>
    The main limitation of generics is the potential increase in code complexity for understanding
    and maintenance. Many programming languages are now developing smarter generic inference
    mechanisms to simplify generic code creation and understanding. In the future, generics might
    integrate with advanced programming paradigms, like metaprogramming and dependent types,
    enhancing code flexibility and expressiveness.
