  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: In React applications, critical security token exposure often results
    from insecure handling and storage of tokens. For instance, storing sensitive tokens in
    client-accessible locations (like localStorage) can lead to exposure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Comparative State</strong>: In modern web development, as the use of front-end
    frameworks and client-side storage increases, this risk becomes more pronounced. Previously,
    sensitive data was handled more on the server side, with relatively lower exposure risks.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Concept Explanation</strong>: In React, critical security token exposure can occur if
    sensitive tokens (like JWT tokens, API keys) are stored or transmitted insecurely on the client
    side. This includes, but is not limited to, storage in localStorage, plaintext transmission in
    client-side JavaScript, or insecure usage of HTTP cookies.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Defensive Principles</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Secure Storage</strong>: Avoid storing sensitive tokens in locations vulnerable to XSS
      attacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Secure Transmission</strong>: Use HTTPS to protect data transmitted between the client
      and the server.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimize Exposure</strong>: Only expose tokens on the client side when necessary, and
      handle sensitive data on the server side as much as possible.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Real-world Example</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Background</strong>: A web application built with React stores user authentication
      tokens in localStorage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Problem</strong>: Due to an XSS attack, malicious scripts can access and steal these
      tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: Switch to securely storing tokens in HTTP-only cookies, thereby
      reducing direct client-side access to sensitive data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    <code>
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Highly insecure: Exposing a security token in client-side code
    const token = 'secret-security-token';
    fetch(`/api/userdata?token=${token}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ userData: data }));
  }

  render() {
    // Render user profile
  }
}
    </code>
  </pre>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Challenges</strong>: As React applications become more complex, developers need to
    remain vigilant about securely storing and transmitting tokens.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Developments</strong>: There might be more tools and libraries developed to help
    securely manage and store sensitive tokens in React applications.
