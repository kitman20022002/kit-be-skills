  <h2>1. Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities exist in all front-end
    frameworks, including React. They occur when an application fails to properly encode or escape
    user input, leading to the embedding and execution of malicious scripts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Comparative State</strong>: Before the advent of modern front-end frameworks like React,
    XSS attacks were mainly executed by directly inserting malicious code into HTML. React reduces
    this risk by automatically escaping HTML, but XSS threats can still arise if not used properly,
    especially in certain scenarios.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Concept Explanation</strong>: In React, XSS typically occurs when developers incorrectly
    handle user input, directly inserting it into the component's output, especially when using the
    <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> property. This can lead to unauthorized code execution,
    such as JavaScript scripts.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Defensive Principles</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Safely Handle User Input</strong>: Never trust user input, always sanitize and escape
      all inputs appropriately.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid Using <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code></strong
      >: Use this property sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Utilize Security Libraries</strong>: Employ libraries like DOMPurify to clean inputs
      that may contain dangerous content.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Real-world Example</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Background</strong>: A social media app allows users to post comments but fails to
      properly handle user inputs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Problem</strong>: Attackers insert JavaScript code in the comments, which executes
      when other users view the comment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution</strong>: Properly sanitize and escape user inputs to ensure no malicious
      scripts are executed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    <code>
    class UnsafeComponent extends React.Component {
        render() {
          // Extremely dangerous: Directly injecting user-controlled content into the HTML
          return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: this.props.userInput }} />;
        }
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Challenges</strong>: With the ongoing development of React and other front-end
    technologies, there's a continuous need to stay vigilant about new security threats and
    defensive methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Developments</strong>: Enhanced security features and more intelligent static
    analysis tools may be developed to automatically identify and prevent potential XSS attacks.
