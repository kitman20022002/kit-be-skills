    <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Origin</strong>: <strong>async/await</strong> is a programming paradigm first
      introduced in C# and .NET, later adopted by JavaScript and other languages. It was created to
      simplify asynchronous programming, making asynchronous code easier to write and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State Change</strong>: Before <strong>async/await</strong>, asynchronous programming
      relied on callbacks and events, leading to "callback hell". With <strong>async/await</strong>,
      asynchronous code structure became clearer and more synchronous in style.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition</strong>: <strong>async/await</strong> allows developers to write
      asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner. The <strong>async</strong> keyword declares a
      function as asynchronous, while <strong>await</strong> waits for an asynchronous operation to
      complete.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Three Key Principles</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Asynchronous Function Declaration</strong>: Functions declared with
        <strong>async</strong> return a Promise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Awaiting Promise Resolution</strong>: <strong>await</strong> is used inside
        <strong>async</strong> functions to wait for Promise resolution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Error Handling</strong>: Use <strong>try/catch</strong> to handle errors in
        asynchronous operations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Practical Example</strong>:</p>
    <p><em>Background</em>: Fetching data from the internet, an asynchronous operation.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Solution</em>: Use <strong>async/await</strong> in a function to await data fetching
      completion.
    </p>
    <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Fetching data failed', error);
    }
}
            </code>
        </pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Limitations</strong>: <strong>async/await</strong> applies only to Promise-based
      operations and not suitable for non-Promise async operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: The industry is exploring better error handling and
      integration of asynchronous flow control tools, like functional programming with
      <strong>async/await</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Future Development</strong>: Potential for more language features and tools to
      simplify asynchronous programming, improving concurrent processing and integration into
      various programming environments.
