  <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin and Background</strong>: The concept of the Call Stack originates from the
    "stack" data structure in computer science. In programming and computer memory management, a
    stack is used to record the sequence of function calls during program execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Comparative State</strong>: Before the widespread understanding of the call stack, the
    mechanism of function calling and returning in programs was harder to track and manage. The
    introduction of the call stack provided a clear and orderly way to manage program execution.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essential Explanation</strong>: In programming languages like JavaScript, the call stack
    is a stack structure that records the calls and execution of functions. When a function is
    called, it is added to the top of the stack; when the function returns, it is removed from the
    top of the stack.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Principles</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Last In, First Out</strong>: The stack follows the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO)
      principle, where the last function pushed onto the stack is the first to complete execution
      and be popped off.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Limited Size</strong>: The size of the call stack is limited, and exceeding its
      capacity can lead to a "stack overflow" error.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Record of Function Execution</strong>: Each function call has its context and
      execution state, all of which are recorded in the stack.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Real-World Example</strong>:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        function firstFunction() {
            secondFunction();
            console.log('Executing first function');
        }

        function secondFunction() {
            console.log('Executing second function');
        }

        firstFunction();
        // Outputs: "Executing second function"
        // Then outputs: "Executing first function"
    </code></pre>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: The size limit of the call stack means that deeply nested or
    infinitely recursive function calls can lead to stack overflow errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Developers need to optimize recursive logic, avoid
    deeply nested calls, or use techniques like tail call optimization to reduce stack usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Developments</strong>: With the evolution of programming languages and runtime
    environments, the management and optimization of the call stack may become more efficient, for
    example, through improved error handling and debugging tools to better manage and visualize the
    call stack.
