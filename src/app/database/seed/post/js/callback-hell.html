  <h2>1. What?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin</strong>: Callback hell originates from the use of callback functions in
    asynchronous programming, especially in environments like Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Comparative State</strong>: Before callback hell became a recognized issue, asynchronous
    operations were handled primarily with callbacks. After the recognition of callback hell,
    alternative approaches like Promises and async/await were developed.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essence</strong>: Callback hell refers to a situation where callbacks are nested within
    other callbacks several levels deep.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nested Structure</strong>: The deeper the nesting, the more complex the callback hell.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Managing errors in callback hell can be challenging.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Readability and Maintenance</strong>: Deeply nested callbacks reduce code readability
      and maintainability.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Real-world Example</strong>:</p>
  <p>Background: Performing multiple asynchronous file operations in Node.js.</p>
  <p>
    Application: Reading a file, then writing to another file, each step nested in the previous
    callback.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
    fs.readFile('file1.txt', function(err, data) {
      if (err) throw err;
      fs.writeFile('file2.txt', data, function(err) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('File written successfully');
      });
    });
    </code>
    </pre>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: The main limitation of callback hell is its impact on code
    quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: Developers have shifted towards using Promises and
    async/await.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Direction</strong>: The trend is to avoid callback hell through better practices
    and newer features like async/await.
