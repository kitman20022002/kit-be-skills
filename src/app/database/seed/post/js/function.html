    <h2>1. Why we need functions?</h2>
    <p>
      It allows programmers to encapsulate code for specific operations. This concept was borrowed
      from earlier programming languages, particularly influenced by Scheme and Java. Without
      functions, code repetition and complexity were common issues and with functions, code became
      more modular, reusable, and maintainable

    <h2>2. What Are They?</h2>
    <p>
      Functions in JavaScript are objects that encapsulate executable code. They can take
      parameters, perform operations, and return values.
    </p>
    <h3>Different Types of Functions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular Functions: Defined with the <strong>function</strong> keyword.</li>
      <li>Anonymous Functions: Nameless functions, often used as callbacks.</li>
      <li>Arrow Functions (ES6): Use <strong>=&gt;</strong> for a concise syntax.</li>
      <li>Generator Functions (ES6): Can be paused and resumed with <strong>yield</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
});
            </code></pre>

    <h2>3. Where Are They Going?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Limitations and Optimization:</b> Overuse or improper use of functions in JavaScript,
        especially in the global scope, can lead to performance issues and hard-to-track errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Future Development:</b> As JavaScript continues to evolve, the concept of functions is
        expanding, for example, with the introduction of arrow functions and generator functions,
        offering new possibilities for writing more efficient and concise code. Additionally,
        functional programming is becoming increasingly popular in JavaScript, emphasizing
        immutability and the use of higher-order functions.
