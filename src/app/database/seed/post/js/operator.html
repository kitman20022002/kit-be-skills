  <h2>1. Where Does It Come From?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Origin and Background</strong>: JavaScript operators originated with the JavaScript
    language itself, designed to facilitate data manipulation and logical expression. JavaScript was
    created in 1995 by Brendan Eich of Netscape to enhance web page interactivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Comparative State</strong>: Before the advent of JavaScript, web page interactivity was
    limited, relying mainly on server-side processing. The introduction of JavaScript and its
    operators allowed for more complex data processing and decision-making on the client side,
    greatly enhancing the dynamism and interactivity of web pages.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Is It?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Essential Explanation</strong>: JavaScript operators are used to perform mathematical
    operations, comparison operations, logical operations, etc. These include arithmetic operators
    (like +, -), comparison operators (like ==, >), logical operators (like &&, ||), and other
    special operators (like the conditional (ternary) operator ? :).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Principles</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Accuracy</strong>: Ensure the correct use of operators to achieve the intended
      results.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Priority</strong>: Understand the precedence among different operators to correctly
      parse expressions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Handling Edge Cases</strong>: Especially in comparison and logical operations, be
      mindful of null values, undefined values, and other special cases.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Real-World Example</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Background: Need to decide an action based on the comparison of two values.</li>
    <li>
      Solution: Use the comparison operator &gt; to determine the size, then use the conditional
      operator to choose the corresponding action.
    </li>
    <li>Sample Code:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        &lt;script&gt;
            let a = 10, b = 20;
            let result = (a &gt; b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
            console.log(result);  // Outputs "b is greater"
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

  <h2>3. Where Is It Going?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitations</strong>: JavaScript operators are limited by the performance and
    application scope of the JavaScript language itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Optimization Direction</strong>: In modern JavaScript development, there is a greater
    focus on combining operators with asynchronous programming and functional programming, such as
    Promises, async/await, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Future Development</strong>: With the evolution of technologies like WebAssembly,
    JavaScript and its operators may increasingly integrate with other language features and
    performance optimizations. Additionally, as the ECMAScript standard continues to evolve, new
    operators and functionalities may be introduced.
