    <h2>1. Why do we need variable declarations (var,let,const) ?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>variable declarations: </strong> Was designed to store data values in a program and
      allow these values to be used in different parts of the program, without it data management in
      programs was more complex, requiring manual management of data storage and retrieval in
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>var:</strong> var was introduced in the early versions of JavaScript for variable
      declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>let and const:</strong> let and const were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to
      address some issues with var, such as hoisting and scope confusion.

    <h2>2. What the difference?</h2>
    <h3>var</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Function scope.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the function or
        global scope.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Reassignable:</strong> Yes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>let</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Block scope (e.g., within {}).</li>
      <li><strong>Hoisting:</strong> Does not hoist.</li>
      <li><strong>Reassignable:</strong> Yes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>const</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Block scope.</li>
      <li><strong>Hoisting:</strong> Does not hoist.</li>
      <li><strong>Reassignable:</strong> No, it declares a constant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
    <p>Declaring a variable in a loop, needing to reassign it in each iteration.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Using var, i is accessible outside the loop
}

for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    // Using let, j is only valid within this loop block
}

const k = 5;
// Using const, the value of k cannot change
            </code></pre>

    <h2>3. Where Are They Going?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Limitations:</strong>
      var: Can lead to scope-related errors. let and const: Relatively stricter, requiring clearer
      scope management.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Optimization Direction:</strong>
      Gradually decrease the use of var in favor of let and const for safer, more predictable code
      behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Future Development:</strong>
      The JavaScript community and standards are leaning towards more use of let and const to
      promote maintainability and readability of code.
