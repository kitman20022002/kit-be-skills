    <div>1. Why we need data type?</div>
    <p>
      The concept of data types in JavaScript originates from the need to categorize data in
      programming languages. It was developed to better manage and use data during programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the advent of JavaScript, other programming languages like C or Java already had their
      own data type systems. The emergence of JavaScript provided a set of data types more suited
      for web pages and web applications.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <div>2. What is it?</div>
    <p>
      JavaScript data types are mainly divided into two categories: primitive types and object
      types.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Primitive types include: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol (added in ES6),
        BigInt (large integer, added in ES2020).
      </li>
      <li>Object types are a composite type, including: Object, Array, Function, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Three principles for applying these data types:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose the appropriate type for efficient data handling.</li>
      <li>Avoid unnecessary type conversions to reduce errors and improve performance.</li>
      <li>Understand the mechanisms of conversion and comparison between types.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Practical example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Background: Collecting age information from users in a web form.</li>
      <li>
        Application: The user's age input (a string) needs to be converted to a number type for
        comparison or calculation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code example:
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
let ageString = "30"; // User-entered age, string type
let ageNumber = Number(ageString); // Convert to number type
if (ageNumber &gt;= 18) {
console.log("Adult");
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">3. Where is it going?</div>
    <p>
      Limitations: Certain JavaScript data types (like global variables) may lead to memory leaks.
      Additionally, type conversions can cause unexpected errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current optimization direction: Enhancing the strictness and consistency of the type system,
      as seen with the introduction of TypeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future development: There might be the addition of new data types or optimization of existing
      types' memory and performance to suit more complex application scenarios.
