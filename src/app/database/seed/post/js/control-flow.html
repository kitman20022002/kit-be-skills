  <h2>1. Why we need control flow?</h2>
  <p>
    Control structures are fundamental components in programming languages used to control the flow
    of code execution. They originated from early programming language designs, aiming to provide
    more flexible and effective code execution paths.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the appearance of JavaScript and other programming languages, program execution was
    typically linear. The introduction of these control structures allowed programmers to execute
    code based on conditions or repeat certain code, making programs more dynamic and flexible.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What is it?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript control structures mainly include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Conditional statements: <b>if</b> and <b>else</b>, used for executing code blocks based on
      specific conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Selection statements: <b>switch</b>, used for executing different code blocks under multiple
      conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Loop statements: <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, and <b>do-while</b>, used for repeatedly executing
      code blocks until a condition is no longer true.
    </li>
    <li>
      Jump statements: <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b>, used for exiting loops early or skipping
      the current loop iteration.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Three principles for applying these control structures:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Choose the appropriate control structure based on the actual situation to simplify code logic
      and improve efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>Be cautious to avoid infinite loops and overly complex conditionals.</li>
    <li>
      Use <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> judiciously to control the loop flow, enhancing code
      readability and efficiency.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Practical example:</p>
  <p>Background: Assign grades based on user-entered scores.</p>
  <p>Application: Use <b>if-else</b> and <b>switch</b> to handle different score ranges.</p>
  <p>Code example:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
let score = 85;
if (score &gt;= 90) {
console.log("Excellent");
} else if (score &gt;= 75) {
console.log("Good");
} else {
console.log("Pass");
}

switch (true) {
case score &gt;= 90:
    console.log("Excellent");
    break;
case score &gt;= 75:
    console.log("Good");
    break;
default:
    console.log("Pass");
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

  <h2>3. Where is it going?</h2>
  <p>
    Limitations: Overuse or improper use of control structures can make code difficult to understand
    and maintain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Current optimization direction: In modern JavaScript development, it's recommended to use more
    concise and expressive control structures, such as arrow functions and Promise structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Possible future developments: New control structures may emerge to adapt to more complex
    programming patterns and demands, like further advancements in asynchronous programming and
    functional programming.
